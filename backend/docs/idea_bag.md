- Notify users direclty with IM (telegram, discord, etc)
- use graphql for the FE (search, keywords, etc)
  - or maybe not!!!
- search on twitter for only "popular" posts option (nof followers, nof replies, etc). This should be an option to the normal search (do 2 searches per keyword if popular is wanted :))
  - inspiration: https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en
- if you want to do token based auth: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enable-cognito-user-pool.html (4.)
- Add to favourite search results (store user on search result ddb, search using ES (give all favourites for!!)
- Do sentiment analysis to searchResults that could be used to filter (maybe-happy?, maybe-negative?) :)
  - http://text-processing.com/docs/sentiment.html (easy free api)
- Send searchResult to google sheets
- send searchResult to airtable?
- smoke tests that search social media
  - bot posts twit with uuid and then we search for it
- create official ms teams bot: https://support.atlassian.com/opsgenie/docs/integrate-opsgenie-with-microsoft-teams/ (that can be downloaded and sideloaded)
- show warning if reports or notifications are selected but not searcher is active
  - in current arch, it won't even produe any reports if keyword is not "active"
- show when reports are searched (daily and weeky(friday)) to the users
- add federated user pools (google, fb, etc) to cognito for easy subscriptions
